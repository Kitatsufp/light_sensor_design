# light_sensor_design
My final exercise for the Applied Electronics subject involves designing a light sensor that measures the amount of light on LCD.
After receiving and testing the sensor, the measured values did not match the calculated results exactly. Therefore, I designed a second version of the board (version 2.0) to improve the performance. However, the tolerance analysis has not been fully calculated yet.
The PCB design files created using Altium Designer have been uploaded to Google Drive.
