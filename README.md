# light_sensor_design
My final exercise for the Applied Electronics subject involves designing a light sensor that measures the amount of light on LCD.
After receiving and testing the sensor, the measured values did not match the calculated results exactly. Therefore, I designed a second version of the board (version 2.0) to improve the performance. However, the tolerance analysis has not been fully calculated yet.
